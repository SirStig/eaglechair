This warranty shall expressly exclude and shall not apply to any Eagle Chair product that has been: installed, used, maintained, modified, repaired or operated in a manner inconsistent with that intended or contemplated by manufacturer; or, damaged because of accident, fire, wind, water or other catastrophic or other sudden unforeseen occurrence, or due to neglect or misuse. In addition, the foregoing warranty shall not apply to any component(s) of the product that is damaged during shipment, distribution, or during unauthorized adjustment, repair or service.\n\nNo warranty is issued on upholstery materials; they are covered by warranties, if any, by the upholstery mills.

This involves inspecting your furniture, tightening all screws and bolts every month, and cleaning and waxing as necessary. For cleaning wood products we suggest Old English Dark Oil on the darker finishes such as walnut, mahogany, etc.; on the light finishes such as natural, maple or cherry, we recommend lemon oil; NEVER, EVER USE WATER. The dealer and any other specifying and reselling party must instruct the user about the maintenance requirements and that the chairs and barstools should only be used for sitting: THEY ARE NOT TO BE USED AS STOOLS, LADDERS, OR COAT HANGERS. The latter will affect the balance of the product.\n\nWood: Particular care should be taken in inspecting the seat rails and bottoms, and front side rails for loose joints and fasteners. A loose joint will transfer all forces on other joints, which will also loosen, with the resultant possibility of the chair/barstool collapsing.\n\nInspections should become more frequent when chairs are over 3 years old, or whenever signs of frame weakness arise. Examinations must include, but not be limited to, structural joints, corner blocks, screws, fasteners, welds and any areas of stress. Missing leg glides or loose casters must be replaced. Chairs exhibiting any of the above should be removed from service and repaired to original standard, or discarded.\n\nANY CHAIR OR BARSTOOL WITH A LOOSE JOINT OR A FASTENER MUST BE TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE IMMEDIATELY.\n\nSteel: Chrome can be cleaned with good automotive chrome cleaner. For touch up of small areas, rust-inhibiting chrome paint can be used. For powder/epoxy finishes use a mild solution of soap and water. Use automotive touch-up paint for small damaged areas after the preparing the area by sanding.\n\nMetal frame members bent at different angles from original are an indication of over stressing and could render frame unstable or prone to sudden failure.\n\nChairs with bent frames should be removed from service; do not attempt to straighten. Rebending frames may further weaken metal and increase potential for failure.\n\nUpholstery: Always work from edges to the center to avoid a halo effect.\n\nVinyl can be cleaned with good automotive vinyl cleaner. Prompt action is necessary, as some types of stains, such as ink, can become permanent if allowed to set.\n\nSuede type vinyl should be not be rubbed but dabbed with mild solution of soap and water.\n\nFabric – because of differences in materials used in our fabrics, it is necessary to determine the type of yarn used to manufacture the particular fabric and then use the recommended cleaning agent for that type of fabric. Use of the wrong agent may result in damage to the fabric.\n\n21/7TM or Krypton®: to remove excess soiling, immediately blot area with dry cloth. To remove remaining stain, spray a light mist of soap solution and rub gently in circular motion with a clean cloth or a toothbrush. Pat dry with cloth. Do not use petroleum or alcohol based cleaners.\n\nRoutine Care For Laminate: To clean the surface, use a damp cloth or sponge and a mild soap or detergent. Difficult stains such as coffee or tea can be removed using a mild household cleaner/detergent and a soft bristle brush, repeating as necessary. If a stain persists, use a paste of baking soda and water and apply with a soft bristled brush. Light scrubbing for 10 to 20 strokes should remove most stains. Although baking soda is a low abrasive, excessive scrubbing or exerting too much force could damage the decorative surface, especially if it has a gloss finish. Stubborn stains that resist any of the above cleaning methods may require the use of undiluted household bleach or nail polish remover. Apply the bleach or nail polish remover to the stain and let stand no longer than two minutes. Rinse thoroughly with warm water and wipe dry. This step may be repeated if the stain appears to be going away and the color of the laminate has not been affected.\n\nWARNING: Prolonged exposure of the laminate surface to bleach will cause discoloration. Special Tips: always rinse laminate surfaces after cleaning! Failure to rinse after cleaning is the single greatest cause of damage to a laminate surface. If even a small amount of cleaning solution remains on the surface, moisture from cups or dishes can reactivate it and result in permanently etched scars. Always rinse thoroughly with clean water and a clean cloth. Sharp knives can damage the surface of laminate. To keep the surface beautiful, use a non-oily furniture spray. Furniture polish can also help hide fine scratches in the surface.\n\nTable Bases: Particular care should be taken in inspecting for missing glides and loose table bases. A loose base can be tightened by flipping the base upside down upon a soft surface, protecting the table top, making sure that all parts are aligned and fitted properly, the center nut holding the tie rod can now be secured. Always pick up table bases before moving them. Sliding table bases will cause damage to the table glides. Use at least two people to lift a table. Some sizes may require more.\n\nCASTERS: Casters are not recommended on hard surfaced floors. Chairs may move too freely and lead to injury. Chairs with four casters are not recommended for elderly care or for persons with impaired ability to seat themselves.\n\nBOOTHS: With few exceptions all of our booth designs can be made to special sizes, angles, with various trims, treatments, cutouts, seats, shapes, custom sewing, etc. All circles and banquettes are standard with unfinished outside backs – if some are to be finished – please specify and add cost of outside back panels.
